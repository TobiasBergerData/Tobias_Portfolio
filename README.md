# Data Scientist Portfolio
Hi there! My name is Tobias Berger.

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. I was trained as a journalist, hold a PhD in sports economics and most recently worked as a futures researcher.

My passion is understanding the intersection of society, economics and ecology. Mostly by analyzing and visualizing data. Oh, and I like sports.

Feel free to have a look at my most recent projects!

#Recent Projects

## [Project 1: TidyTuesday Contributions - Overview](https://github.com/TobiasBergerData/TidyTuesday_Python)
* TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project.
* It provides interesting data regularly and invites you to engage with it.
* I participate from time to time, using Python and Jupyter Notebook, to test out new data science techniques, libraries or plots.
* All my analyses and visualizations of TidyTuesday datasets are posted here - code and results.
* The topic range is huge, from climate data to mountain climbers.
