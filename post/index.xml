      <description>An Elo Rating, or simply Elo, is a rating system used to measure the relative skill levels of players or teams in games and sports. It was originally developed for chess by Arpad Elo but has been widely adopted in various sports, including soccer. The Elo rating system provides a numerical representation of a player&amp;rsquo;s or team&amp;rsquo;s skill, making it easier to compare and rank them. In soccer, Elo ratings can be applied to both club teams and national teams, offering a standardized way to evaluate and rank their performances.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered this interesting data set , containing all studio album songs of one of my favorite bands of all time - Radiohead. I checked out how the band has progressed over time looking at their 9 studio albums. This meant examining hard facts like song durations and temporal profiles of their records. However I also analyzed softer dimensions like valence, lyrical density and sadness of the words sung.</description>

      <description>TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project. It provides interesting data regularly and invites you to engage with it. I participate regularly, using Python and Jupyter Notebook, to test out new data science techniques, libraries or plots. All my analyses and visualizations of TidyTuesday datasets are posted here - code and results. The topic range is huge, from climate data to mountain climbers. Link to GitHub Repository
